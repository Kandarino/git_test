<p>Facts on dogs:</p>
<ul>
    <li>They don't clean themselves.</li>
    <li>They can pro-create</li>
    <li>They can be trained to attack x-men on sight. Amazing.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're interested in that last bit, here's a <a href="https://xmenhuntingdogs.com.au">link</a> with a tutorial.</p>
<h2>The xman doge in the wild.</h2>
<p>Typically, you can find an xman capable doge in most grassy areas. Look for clearings in the grass, as it is likely the result of the fat body of the doge which has created the clearing. Any old Pokeball will do in catching such a doge. If above 130kg, it's probably an older dog, and is usually harder to train to xman tier. But they can still be utilized in harassing college girls through various techniques such as catcalling.</p>
