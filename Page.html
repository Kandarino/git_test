<h1>I'm interested in craft beer.</h1>
<p>Facts on dogs:</p>
<ul>
    <li>They don't clean themselves.</li>
    <li>They can pro-create</li>
    <li>They can be trained to attack x-men on sight. Amazing.</li>
</ul>

<h6>I genuinely wonder how small this header text is. I can also <strong>embolden</strong> words now.</h6>
<p>Funny thing is that I literally <strong>made that word bold</strong> but you can't tell because the text is too small to be put in bold.</p>
<p>Also, I wonder why the ul and h6 elements aren't affected by my css file.</p>

This sentence has no p or h or anything. Wonder why that's a bad thing? I guess I can't style it? But what other problems?
